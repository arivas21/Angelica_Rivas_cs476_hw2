Please download all files in the "src" folder and the build.sbt file in order to run my program. Once it is installed in IntelliJ, please open the Demo.scala found in the src
tab under main. Please run the Demo.scala to show the functionality of my program. 

In order to access the tests I created for my program please first open the build.sbt file and make sure both library dependencies are in the file in order run the scala tests.
Next, open the ExpressionTest.Scala to view the tests i created both class methods. Then run the program to view the reulsts of the tests.
